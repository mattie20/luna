### Purpose

To bring a better CAD system to the world long dominated by the Solidworks and Autodesk duopoly. To make software that is built and supported with the end user in mind.

### How we are going to get there

- Creating a minimum viable product that supports the basic operations of commom CAD packages that are used 70% of the time
- Expanding that mvp over the span of five years to incorporate advanced features that will differentiate Luna from its closed source competitors
- Utilizing the existing codebase, branch out into Civil Engineering and architecture products
